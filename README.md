#🚖 OLA Ride Analysis – Data Analyst Project (SQL + Power BI)

Hi, I'm Chitransh Rahangdale, and this is my professional-level data analyst project based on ride booking data from OLA Cabs. In this project, I worked on a simulated dataset representing real-world ride booking patterns in Bengaluru, India.

📌 Project Summary
This project aims to derive meaningful business insights from OLA's ride booking data using SQL for analysis and Power BI for visualization. The dataset includes over 100,000 records covering bookings made throughout a month.

🔍 Project Goals
Understand ride booking behavior in Bengaluru.

Identify cancellation trends from customers and drivers.

Analyze ride performance based on vehicle types.

Calculate overall ride revenue and distance trends.

Visualize customer and driver ratings.

Build dashboards for business reporting.

🧾 Key Data Columns Used
Date & Time of booking

Vehicle Type: Auto, Prime Sedan, SUV, Mini, Bike, etc.

Pickup & Drop Location (50+ Bangalore areas)

Booking Status: Success, Cancelled by Customer, Cancelled by Driver, Incomplete

Booking Value, Ride Distance

Customer/Driver Ratings

Cancellation Reasons

Payment Methods (Cash, UPI, etc.)

📊 Tools & Technologies Used
SQL: For data querying, filtering, aggregation, and insights.

Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and charts.

Excel: For initial data cleaning and simulation.

✅ What I Did in the Project
🔎 Data Analysis with SQL:
Analyzed successful bookings and cancellation patterns.

Found average ride distances for different vehicle types.

Identified top customers based on number of bookings and revenue.

Checked reasons behind ride cancellations and incomplete rides.

Aggregated data to calculate total revenue, average ratings, etc.

📈 Visualization with Power BI:
Ride Trends: Number of bookings per day/week.

Booking Status Breakdown: Success vs cancellations.

Revenue Analysis: By payment methods & customers.

Top Vehicle Performance: By ride distance.

Ratings Dashboard: Driver vs Customer comparison.

Cancellation Reasons: Customer vs Driver behavior.

📌 Key Business Insights
🚗 Prime Sedan had the longest average ride distance.

📅 Weekends and match days saw a rise in bookings.

❌ Customer cancellations were mostly due to driver delays.

💳 UPI was the most used payment method.

🌟 Ratings were higher for SUVs and Prime vehicles.

📉 Incomplete rides were rare and mostly due to vehicle issues.
